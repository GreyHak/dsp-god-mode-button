# God Mode Button for Dyson Sphere Program

**DSP God Mode Button** is a mod for the Unity game Dyson Sphere Program developed by Youthcat Studio and published by Gamera Game.  The game is available on [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366540/Dyson_Sphere_Program/).

This mod will display the god build mode setting on the HUD and allow you to change it with a button click.

This mod was requested by KoS.

If you want to toggle god build mode with a key press, I suggest you try [doobist](https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/doobist/)'s [Toggle God Mode](https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/doobist/Toggle_God_Mode/) mod.  This mod is not intended to replace Toggle God Mode, but instead to work with it by showing the mode state on the HUD.
